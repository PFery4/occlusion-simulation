  other_agents: "OUT"                               # can be either "IN" or "OUT". Defines whether the agent belonging to classes outside the selected "agent_types" are kept as eventual providers of social context for the prediction ("IN"), or whether they are completely removed from the dataset in preprocessing, resulting in the model disregarding those agents entirely ("OUT")
  min_N_agents: 1                                   # [-] minimum number of fully observed agents for a candidate instance window to be made part of the dataset

  simulations_per_instance: 1   # [-] number of runs per SDD instance (only used when running the sim on the whole dataset)
  n_target_agents: 1            # [-] number of desired agents to occlude virtually
