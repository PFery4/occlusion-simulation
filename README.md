# OCCLUSION SIMULATOR FOR TRAJECTORY DATASETS

This repository contains the code for a simulator, that is capable of generating *spatio-temporally defined occlusions* from trajectory data that is widely available within the trajectory prediction research field.

Our simulator generates occlusion cases from agents' trajectories, focusing on generating cases for which the agents are *currently occluded*.

We provide code for our simulator, as well as the necessary preprocessing functionalities for its operation on the [Stanford Drone Dataset](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/uav_data/).
